# MetaChain

MetaChain is a fully decentralized messaging app with an integrated token economy, built on the Minima blockchain.[web:4][web:7] Every chat and payment is peer‑to‑peer, end‑to‑end encrypted, and routed without central servers, so users keep full control of their data and keys.[web:4][web:7]

MetaChain lets people communicate, pay, and run rewarded campaigns in a single, censorship‑resistant network where users get paid for their attention instead of being tracked by platforms.[web:4][web:9]

## Key features

- **Decentralized private chats** – 1:1, groups and channels over pure P2P, with E2E encryption and no central fallback.[web:7][web:9]  
- **Granular privacy profiles** – per‑field visibility (public, close contacts, personal contacts) for identity data.  
- **Instant P2P payments** – send and receive tokens directly inside chats as a natural part of the conversation.  
- **Charms** – positive messages combined with token micropayments to encourage constructive interactions.  
- **Open Posts** – a decentralized public board to publish services, offers and announcements visible to the whole network.  
- **Reward Campaigns** – creators run ad campaigns that appear in chats; users earn tokens for viewing and interacting.  
- **Transparent 7% fee model** – campaigns pay a flat 7% fee, with 6% funding MetaChain and 1–2% optionally shared with partners.

## Why Minima

MetaChain is built on Minima, a mobile‑first, DePIN‑oriented layer‑1 blockchain where every device can run a full node.[web:4][web:7][web:9] This architecture provides strong censorship resistance, quantum‑resistant encryption and true decentralization without relying on heavy infrastructure or centralized validators.[web:4][web:7]

## Project status

MetaChain is currently under active development as a MiniDapp on the Minima network.[web:4][web:14] The core P2P messaging architecture and token integration are defined, and the MVP roadmap targets a first public beta aligned with Minima’s mobile‑node ecosystem.[web:4][web:7][web:14]

## High‑level architecture

- Minima layer‑1 blockchain for consensus, token issuance and on‑chain accounting.[web:4][web:7][web:9]  
- P2P messaging layer for chats, charms and Open Posts, running directly between nodes.  
- Reward Campaigns engine that allocates campaign budgets, tracks impressions/interactions, and distributes token rewards.  
- Client app exposing profiles, chats, payments, Open Posts and campaign management in a unified UX.
